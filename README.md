# **Conversational-NLP-Chatbot-Using-Tensorflow-and-Keras** <br/>

**Tools Used:** Python 3, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, NumPy, JSON, Pickle <br/>
**Result:** This project is a simple yet powerful intent-based chatbot built using Python, TensorFlow's Keras API, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK.
<br/><br/>
**Description:** <br/>
Classifies user inputs into predefined intents using deep learning. <br>
Utilizes tokenization, stemming, and a bag-of-words model for text preprocessing. <br>
Intent dataset is stored in a structured intents.json file. <br>
Trained a multi-layer feedforward neural network using Sequential API from Keras. <br>
Includes intent classification logic and dynamic response selection based on model predictions. <br>
Automatically saves and loads model weights using .h5 format. <br>
